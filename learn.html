       <h2 class="hobbies-titles"> My name is Andrew Popovic and I am 17 years old. I am excited to share the ways in which I spend my free time with my fellow students and friends.</h2>
        <h2 class="hobbies-titles">I have listed a few of my hobbies below.</h2>
        <h3 class="hobbies-titles">Swimming</h3>
        <section>
          <br>
          <p>I love swimming and I am usually at the pool every day after school. I enjoy swimming freestyle the most. I look up to my coaches and fellow swimmers who have been recruited to swim in college.</p>
        </section>
        <h3 class="hobbies-titles">Driving</h3>
        <section>
          <br>
          <p>I love driving around the city all the time. It doesn't matter if there is a reason for doing so or not. My dad got me a very nice new car as an early birthday present, so I've been putting tons of miles on it since the day I pulled it into my driveway.</p>
        </section>
        <h3 class="hobbies-titles">NBA Games</h3>
        <section>
          <br>
          <p>Whenever I get bored at home, I usually like to research things about the National Basketball Association. I play yahoo fantasy basketball, and I also love to play NBA2K23. I like rebuilding teams and sending them to the championship.</p>
        </section>
         <h3 class="hobbies-titles">Food</h3>
        <section>
          <br>
          <p>I have always loved food. I eat Chipotle very often. My favorite food is chicken. You will also find me at Raising Canes Chicken Fingers a lot. I also like Culver's, Subway, Chick-fil-a, Dairy Queen, and Dominos.</p>
        </section>
        <h3 class="hobbies-titles">My Current Job</h3>
        <section>
          <br>
          <p>I currently work at the Twinsburg Fitness Center as a lifeguard. I really enjoy the job and the people who I work with are great, but I plan on getting a job in the Computer Science field when I am older.</p>
